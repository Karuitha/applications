**RE: `r toupper(jobtitle)`**

I write to apply for `r jobtitle` at `r place`. I have submitted my PhD thesis in Financial Economics at the `University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg` in South Africa, expecting to graduate in June 2022. Furthermore, I have over 15 years of experience in education, finance, research, data analysis and related roles that call for continuous learning. I aspire for a career involving the analysis of quantitative and qualitative data. Hence, the `r jobtitle` provides aligns with my career goals. In the next section, I describe my work experience that correlates highly with `r jobtitle` requirements. 

I have worked extensively with data in my research work in all these roles. For instance, as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) at Wits University for five years, I worked extensively with data from the `World Bank`, `IMF`, and other UN bodies. I also analysed data from the Microfinance Information Exchange (MIX), Bloomberg and Bank Scope. I have also previously worked as a research assistant with the `Kenya Institute of Public Policy Research and Analysis` (KIPPRA), collecting and analysing qualitative and quantitative survey data. I am also comfortable leading `focus group discussions` (FGDs). 

I have advanced skills in `R programming` and `Ms Excel`, with sound working knowledge of `SQL`, `Stata` and `Eviews`. I am also well versed in `R Markdown` and version control using `Git and GitHub` and familiar with Big Data analytics ecosystems like `Hadoop`, `MapReduce`, and `Spark`. Further, I have skills in Financial Statements Analysis, Valuation, Capital Budgeting, and Economic Analysis. 

I can explain the results of data analysis to a non-technical audience, given my background in education as a teacher and tutorial fellow. My seven articles in several newspapers attest to this capability, as do data projects on Rpubs (www.rpubs.com/Karuitha). I have also written three research articles and am currently working on three research papers from my PhD thesis. 

I am currently in academia. However, I have previously held professional positions. At Twana Twitu Cares, an NGO, I was in charge of finance, writing financial reports for the management and donors (USAID and AMREF). I was the project manager at NECLI, a livelihoods improvement and environmental conservation community-based organisation, at the time, funded by the EU and DANIDA. In the latter role, I liaised with community members to implement interventions that mitigate unsustainable exploitation of the environment, such as illegal logging and poaching of Sandalwood.

I am excited at the prospect of bringing my talents to `r place` Office. At your earliest convenience, I look forward to hearing from you to discuss how my experience and qualifications will prove valuable in the `r jobtitle` role. 

This statement of interest highlights how well my education and experience fits the `r jobtitle` role. I am sharing with you my resume for more details. My `LinkedIn` profile also expounds on my skills and work experience.
