**RE: APPLICATION - `r toupper(jobtitle)`**

I write to apply for `r jobtitle` at `r place`. 

I have over 15 years of experience in education, finance, research, data analysis and related roles. I have worked extensively with data in my research work in all these roles. For instance, as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) at University of the Witwatersrand for five years, I worked extensively with data from the World Bank, IMF, and other UN bodies. I also analysed data from the Microfinance Information Exchange (MIX), Bloomberg and BankScope. 

I have advanced skills in R programming and Ms Excel, with sound working knowledge of SQL, Stata and Eviews. I am also well versed in R Markdown and version control using Git and GitHub and familiar with Big Data analytics ecosystems like Hadoop, MapReduce, and Spark. Further, I have skills in Financial Statements Analysis, Valuation, Budgeting, Capital Budgeting, and Economic Analysis. I also embrace continuous learning.

What is more, I can explain the results of data analysis to a non-technical audience, given my background in education as a teacher and tutorial fellow. My articles in several newspapers, websites and journals attest to this capability, as do data projects on Rpubs (www.rpubs.com/Karuitha), my GitHub profile (github.com/Karuitha) and LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/Karuitha). 

Although I am currently in academia, I have previously held professional positions. At Twana Twitu Cares, an NGO, I was in charge of finance, where I did financial reports for the management and donors (USAID and AMREF). I was the project manager at NECLI, a livelihoods improvement and environmental conservation community-based organisation, at the time, funded by the EU and DANIDA. 

Given my background, I can handle the tasks of an `r jobtitle`. Please feel free to contact me for further information or clarification. 


Best regards,
