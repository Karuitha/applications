Dear Sir,

**RE: `r toupper(jobtitle)`**

I write to apply for the adjustment of my commuting allowance.

While I previously did not have a car, I have since purchased one (registration *KDH 685C*).

I am attached to the School of Business, Department of Business and Economics. My PF number is 0266.

I am sharing with you the relevant documents.

Yours Sincerely,
