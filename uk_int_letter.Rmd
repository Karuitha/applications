**RE: APPLICATION - `r str_to_upper(jobtitle)`**

I write to apply for the position of `r jobtitle` at `r place`.

I have over 15 years of experience in education, research, data analysis, finance, and related roles. I have advanced skills in R, Ms Excel, and Machine Learning. I have intermediate (and growing) SQL, Python, Anaconda, and Visual Studio Code and a working knowledge of Stata, Eviews, and Big Data analytics ecosystems like Hadoop and Spark. 

As a research assistant at the Wits Business School in South Africa, I worked with the World Bank, IMF, MIX, and FRED data for five years. As a macroeconomic statistician specialising in sovereign debt with `Trounceflow`, I collected and analysed global data on sovereign debt, deficits, and surpluses. I have severally participated in the collection and analysis of survey data. 

I submitted my PhD thesis in Financial Economics at the `University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg` in South Africa, expecting to graduate in December 2022. My research examined the transformation of micro-finance institutions in Africa. Hence, I have well-developed knowledge in research methodology, financial economics, SDGs, sovereign debt and statistical (econometrics) analysis. 

Although currently in academia, I have previously held professional positions. At Twana Twitu Cares, an NGO in Kenya, I was in charge of finance, where I did financial reports for the management and donors (USAID and AMREF). I managed a livelihoods improvement and environmental conservation project in Kenya funded by the EU and DANIDA. 

Importantly, I embrace continuous learning. I am undertaking data science courses and independent data analysis projects. Additional information is available on `Rpubs` (<https://www.rpubs.com/Karuitha>) and `Linkedin`  (<https://www.linkedin.com/in/karuitha/>). 

Given my background, I believe I can handle the tasks of `r jobtitle`. Please feel free to contact me for further information or clarification.
