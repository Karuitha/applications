**RE: APPLICATION - `r toupper(jobtitle)`**

I write to apply for the position of `r jobtitle` at `r place`.

I submitted my PhD thesis in Financial Economics at the `University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg` in South Africa, expecting to graduate in June 2022. My research examined the transformation of Microfinance Institutions in Africa. Hence, I have well-developed knowledge in finance, rural finance and markets, financial development and inclusion, and financial management. I have over 15 years of experience in education, research, finance, and related roles. 

The research journey saw me gain advanced skills in data analytics- R and Ms Excel, and SQL, and basics in Stata and Eviews. I am also familiar with Big Data analytics ecosystems like Hadoop and Spark. As a research assistant at the Wits Business School, I have worked with the World Bank, IMF, MIX, and FRED data for five years.  

Importantly, I embrace continuous learning, a critical personal quality in the era of rapid technological changes that also affect data analytics. Currently, I am undertaking data science courses and independent data science projects. Additional information is available on my `GitHub` account (<https://www.github.com/Karuitha>) and `Linkedin` profile page (<https://www.linkedin.com/in/karuitha/>). 

Although I am currently in academia, I have previously held professional positions. At Twana Twitu Cares, an NGO, I was in charge of finance, where I did financial reports for the management and donors (USAID and AMREF). I was the project manager at NECLI, a livelihoods improvement and environmental conservation community-based organisation funded by the EU and DANIDA. I also worked as a macroeconomic statistician specialising in sovereign debt with `Trounceflow` for three months. 

Given my background, I believe I can handle the tasks of `r jobtitle`. Please feel free to contact me for further information or clarification.
