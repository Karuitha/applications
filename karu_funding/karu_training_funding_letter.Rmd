Dear Sir,

**RE: REQUEST FOR FINANCING - DATA ANALYTICS TRAINING**

I am writing to request funding to support my attendance of `r place` `r training` training from 12-16th September 2022 in Mombasa, Kenya.

I am a member of ISACA (Kenya Chapter), which requires participation in continuous professional education to retain membership. ISACA is a global Information technology body with  a mission to:

> * help business technology professionals and their enterprises around the world realize the positive potential of technology... (by) inspiring confidence that enables innovation through technology.* <https://www.isaca.org/why-isaca/about-us> 

I also teach two finance and accounting courses that have substantial Ms Excel content; *BBM 419: Financial Statements Analysis* and *BBM 450: Practical Accounting Data Processing*. Hence, this training will contribute directly to my teaching.


Yours Sincerely,

```{r eval=F, echo=FALSE, out.width='30%'}
