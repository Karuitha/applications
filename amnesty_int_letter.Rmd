**RE: APPLICATION - `r toupper(jobtitle)`**

I write to apply for the position of `r jobtitle` at `r place`.

I submitted my PhD thesis in Financial Economics at the `University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg` in South Africa, expecting to graduate in December 2022. My research examined the transformation of microfinance institutions in Africa. Hence, I have well-developed knowledge in research methodology, financial economics, SDGs, sovereign debt and statistical (econometrics) analysis.  

As a research assistant at the Wits Business School in South Africa, I have worked with the World Bank, IMF, MIX, and FRED data for five years. As a macroeconomic statistician specialising in sovereign debt with `Trounceflow`, I collected and analysed global data on sovereign debt, debt deficits, and surpluses.

Although currently in academia, I have previously held professional positions. At Twana Twitu Cares, an NGO in Kenya, I was in charge of finance, where I did financial reports for the management and donors (USAID and AMREF). I was the project manager at NECLI, a livelihoods improvement and environmental conservation community-based organisation in Kenya funded by the EU and DANIDA. I have over 15 years of experience in education, research, finance, and related roles.

The research journey saw me gain advanced skills in data analytics- R, Ms Excel, SQL, Stata, Eviews and rising proficiency in Python Programming. I am also familiar with Big Data analytics ecosystems like Hadoop and Spark. 

Importantly, I embrace continuous learning. I am undertaking data science courses and independent data analysis projects. Additional information is available on my `GitHub` account (<https://www.github.com/Karuitha>) and `Linkedin` site (<https://www.linkedin.com/in/karuitha/>). 

Given my background, I believe I can handle the tasks of `r jobtitle`. Please feel free to contact me for further information or clarification.
