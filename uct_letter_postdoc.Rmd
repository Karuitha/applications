**RE: APPLICATION - `r toupper(jobtitle)`**

I write to apply for the position of `r jobtitle` at the `r place`.

In October 2021, I submitted my PhD thesis in Financial Economics at the `University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg` in South Africa, expecting to graduate in June 2022. My PhD research examined the transformation of Microfinance Institutions in Africa. I have over 15 years of experience in education (including working with teenagers in High Schools and university undergraduate students), research, finance, and related roles. 

The PhD research journey saw me gain expert level skills in R programming and Ms Excel, with sound working knowledge of SQL, Stata and Eviews. I have also become familiar with Big Data analytics ecosystems like SQL, Hadoop, and Spark. Moreover, as a research assistant at the Wits Business School, I have had five years of practical experience working with Bloomberg, IMF, the World Bank data, the mainstream UN system and other data sets.  

Importantly, I embrace continuous learning, a critical personal quality in the era of rapid technological changes that also affect the evolving data science field. Currently, I am undertaking further data science courses to further my knowledge and independent data science projects. Further information is available in my `GitHub` account (see github.com/Karuitha) and `Linkedin` profile page (see <https://www.linkedin.com/in/karuitha/>). 

Although I am currently in academia, I have previously held professional positions. At Twana Twitu Cares, an NGO, I was in charge of finance, where I did financial reports for the management and donors (USAID and AMREF). I was the project manager at NECLI, a livelihoods improvement and environmental conservation community-based organisation, at the time, funded by the EU and DANIDA. 

Given my background, I believe I can perform well in the role. Please feel free to contact me for further information or clarification.
