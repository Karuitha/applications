**RE: APPLICATION - REGIONAL OFFICE DATA ANALYST**

I write to apply for the position of `r jobtitle` at `r place`.

My journey into data analysis was born of necessity while pursuing post-graduate research in Financial Economics at the `University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg` in South Africa, from 2017. My PhD research examined the transformation of Microfinance Institutions in Africa. I am to graduate later in 2021 or early 2022. The research journey saw me learn R programming by taking the `Professional Certificate in Data Science` course offered by Harvard University through EDx. 

Consequently, I have become familiar with Big Data analytics ecosystems like SQL, Hadoop, and Spark through these courses. Moreover, as a research assistant at the Wits Business School, I have had five years of practical experience working with Bloomberg and the World Bank data.  

Importantly, I embrace continuous learning, a critical personal quality in the era of rapid technological changes that also affect the evolving data science field. Currently, I am undertaking further data science courses to further my knowledge and independent data science projects. Further information is available in my `GitHub` account (see github.com/Karuitha) and `Linkedin` profile page (see <https://www.linkedin.com/in/karuitha/>). 

Although I am currently in academia, I have previously held professional positions. At Twana Twitu Cares, an NGO, I was in charge of finance, where I did financial reports for the management and donors (USAID and AMREF). I was the project manager at NECLI, a livelihoods improvement and environmental conservation community-based organisation, at the time, funded by the EU and DANIDA. 

Given my background, I believe I can handle the tasks of a `r jobtitle`. Please feel free to contact me for further information or clarification.
