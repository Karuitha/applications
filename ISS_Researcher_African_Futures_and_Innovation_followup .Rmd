**Follow-up Queries for `r jobtitle`**

I have received your follow-up queries for my `r jobtitle` application.

My responses are as follows;

1. **The position requires the candidate to be based in Pretoria. Are you willing to relocate?**

- Yes, I am willing to relocate. I have the advantage that I lived in Johannesburg between 2017-2021 and hence familiar with the culture and environment in South Africa.

2. **If willing to relocate, will you be relocating alone?**

- Yes, I will relocate alone.

3. **What is your gross salary expectation in ZAR per month.**

- My expected salary is negotiable around **ZAR 50,000** per month.


You may contact me in case of further information or clarification.

Best regards,
