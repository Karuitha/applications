Dear Sir,

**RE: `r toupper(jobtitle)`**

Kindly receive my sincere apologies for being late in the submission of the staff appraisal form. 

I could not submit it on time because I had filled and submitted the incorrect form. 

I realize this could have caused some inconvenience. That shall never happen again in the future.

I have already filled out the correct form. Kindly accept the document attached to this letter.

Yours Sincerely,

```{r eval=F, echo=FALSE, out.width='30%'}
# knitr::include_graphics('john-hancock.png')
# ^ put your signature here as a PNG or something.
```
