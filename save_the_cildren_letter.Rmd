**RE: APPLICATION - `r toupper(jobtitle)`**

I write to apply for the position of `r jobtitle` at `r place`.

My experience in data analysis spans over 10 years. During this period, I have gained skills in data analysis using R, Python, SQL, Stata, and E-Views. I am also familiar with Big Data analytics ecosystems like Hadoop and Spark. 

Importantly, I embrace continuous learning. I am undertaking data science courses and independent data analysis projects. Additional information is available on my `GitHub` account (<https://www.github.com/Karuitha>) and `rpubs` site (<https://www.rpubs.com/karuitha/>). 

As a research assistant at the `Wits Business School` in South Africa, I have worked with the World Bank, IMF, MIX, and FRED data for five years. As a macroeconomic statistician specialising in sovereign debt with `Trounceflow` (UK, Remote), I collected and analysed global data on sovereign debt, debt deficits, and surpluses. I have also participated in field data collection and analysis with the `Kenya Institute of Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA)`. My post-graduate education also grounded me in research methodology, inclusing data collection and management.

Although currently in academia, I have previously held professional positions. At `Twana Twitu Cares`, an NGO in Kenya, I was in charge of finance, where I did financial reports for the management and donors (USAID and AMREF). I was the project manager at `NECLI`, a livelihoods improvement and environmental conservation community-based organisation in Kenya funded by the EU and DANIDA. I have over 10 years of experience in education, research, finance, and related roles.

Given my background, I believe I can handle the tasks of `r jobtitle`. Please feel free to contact me for further information or clarification.
