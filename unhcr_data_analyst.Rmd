**RE: APPLICATION - `r toupper(jobtitle)`**

I write to apply for `r jobtitle` at `r place`. I have submitted my PhD thesis in Financial Economics at the `University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg` in South Africa, expecting to graduate in June 2022. Furthermore, I have over 15 years of experience in education, finance, research, data analysis and related roles. 

I have worked extensively with data in my research work in all these roles. For instance, as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) at Wits University for five years, I worked extensively with data from the World Bank, IMF, and other UN bodies. I also analysed data from the Microfinance Information Exchange (MIX), Bloomberg and BankScope. 

I am currently in academia. However, I have previously held professional positions. At Twana Twitu Cares, an NGO, I was in charge of finance, where I did financial reports for the management and donors (USAID and AMREF). I was the project manager at NECLI, a livelihoods improvement and environmental conservation community-based organisation, at the time, funded by the EU and DANIDA. 

I have advanced skills in R programming and Ms Excel, with sound working knowledge of SQL, Stata and Eviews. I am also well versed in R Markdown and version control using Git and GitHub and familiar with Big Data analytics ecosystems like Hadoop, MapReduce, and Spark. Further, I have skills in Financial Statements Analysis, Valuation, Capital Budgeting, and Economic Analysis. Importantly, I embrace continuous learning. I can explain the results of data analysis to a non-technical audience, given my background in education as a teacher and tutorial fellow. My articles in several newspapers attest to this capability, as do data projects on Rpubs (www.rpubs.com/Karuitha). 

I am excited at the prospect of bringing my talents to UNHCR Office. I look forward to hearing from you, at your earliest convenience, to discuss how my experience and qualifications will prove valuable in the `r jobtitle` role. 


Best regards,
