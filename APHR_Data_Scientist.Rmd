**The Human Resources Officer**,

*African Population and Health Research Center, Inc (APHRC),*

*P.O. Box 10787-GPO, Nairobi.*

Dear Hiring Manager,

**APPLICATION: `r toupper(jobtitle)`**

I write to apply for the position of `r jobtitle` at `r place`.

I have submitted my PhD thesis in Finance and will graduate in June 2023 from University of the Witwatersrand. I am a research fellow at the African Centre for the Study of the USA focusing on Africa-USA economics and trade. Related articles are in my linkedin site. 

My experience in research, data analysis, education, finance, and related roles spans over a decade. During this period, I have gained skills in data analysis using R, Python, SQL, Stata, and E-Views. I am also familiar with Big Data analytics ecosystems like Hadoop and Spark. 

As a research assistant at the `Wits Business School` in South Africa, I have worked with the World Bank, IMF, MIX, and FRED data for five years. As a macroeconomic statistician specializing in sovereign debt with `Trounceflow` (UK, Remote), I collected and analysed global data on sovereign debt. I have also participated in field data collection and analysis with the `Kenya Institute of Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA)`. 

Although currently in academia, I have previously held professional positions. At `Twana Twitu Cares`, an NGO in Kenya, I was in charge of finance, where I did financial reports for the management and donors (USAID and AMREF). I was the project manager at `NECLI`, a livelihoods and environmental conservation CBO in Kenya funded by the EU and DANIDA.

My central philosophy is continuous learning. I am undertaking data science courses and projects available in my `rpubs` site (<https://www.rpubs.com/karuitha/>). 

Given my background, I believe I can handle the tasks of `r jobtitle`. Please feel free to contact me for further information or clarification.
