**RE: APPLICATION FOR THE POSITION OF DATA SCIENTIST**

I write to apply for the advertised opening of `r jobtitle` at `r place`.

My journey into data analysis was born of necessity while pursuing post-graduate research in Financial Economics at the `University of the Witwatersrand, Johanneburg` South Africa, from 2017. The commercial data analysis software I was running could not handle my tasks unless I upgraded to a more capable and costlier version. 

At this point, my attention turned to open source software, with R an appealing choice given its prominence in research and statistics. I enrolled for the `Professional Certificate in Data Science`, a course offered by Harvard University through EDx. 

I cleared the course, allowing me to complete my research (I am awaiting the thesis examiners' reports). The course also sparked my interest in data science. Hence, I took additional data analysis and machine learning training as detailed in the attached CV and my `Linkedin` profile page (see <https://www.linkedin.com/in/karuitha/>). In the process, I have become familiar with Big Data analytics ecosystems like Hadoop and Spark. 

Importantly, I embrace continuous learning, a critical personal quality in the era of rapid technological changes that also affect the evolving data science field. Currently, I am undertaking further data science courses to further my knowledge and independent data science projects in my `GitHub` account (see github.com/Karuitha). 

Although I am currently in academia, I have previously held professional positions. At Twana Twitu Cares, an NGO, I was in charge of finance, where I did financial reports for the management and donors (USAID and AMREF). I was the project manager at NECLI, a livelihoods improvement and environmental conservation community-based organisation, at the time, funded by the EU and DANIDA. 

Given my background, I believe I can handle the tasks of a data scientist. Please feel free to contact me for further information or clarification.
